                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>In 1965 the predecessor to MicroMetl Corporation was founded in Indianapolis, Indiana as General Sheet Metal (GSM). 
                  GSM was a sheet metal shop that manufactured and installed local HVAC duct systems for the construction market. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In the mid-1970s, roof curbs and downturn plenums were being manufactured for the Bryant Air Conditioning plant and a few regional HVAC distributors. 
                  It was at this time the name was changed to MicroMetl Corporation.
                  Innovative products and superior customer service led to MicroMetl being named one of the Inc. 500 fastest growing small businesses in the U.S. for the years 1983 and 1984. 
                  <br><br>
                  
                  In the 1990s the industry and codes were moving toward bringing in more outside air to dilute indoor contaminants (carpets, carbon monoxide, cleaning chemicals, etc.) and provide outdoor air as an energy-saving method to provide free-cooling for the building space.
                  MicroMetl&#x27s product line moved toward these types of products, which include economizers, manual and motorized dampers, and the related power exhaust lines. 
                  With a fresh product line, the company opened a second location in Sparks, Nevada to service west coast HVAC distributors. 
                  <br><br>

                  In 2001 MicroMetl partnered with the Carrier Corporation, to manufacture their outside air accessories to be installed both in the field and at their Tyler, Texas manufacturing facility.
                  By 2005 the volume had increased to the point that an additional manufacturing facility was needed.
                  Due to Carrier&#x27s location and the longer-term opportunities for other OEM business, Longview, Texas was selected as the location of the third plant. 
                  <br><br>

                  In addition to building for Carrier (which includes brands Bryant, Day & Night, ICP, and others), the Longview location has become the main HVAC accessory supplier for almost all other major commercial HVAC manufacturers. 
                  The importance of indoor air quality and the push toward energy-efficiency led to new codes throughout the country which created the greater use of economizers.
                  In addition, these codes require economizer performance to be verified. 
                  <br><br>

                  Over the last several years MicroMetl has led the industry in product certifications.
                  To meet the growing demand for commercial HVAC accessories, MicroMetl has continued to invest in the latest manufacturing technology to increase throughput, improve accuracy and quality.
                  Today MicroMetl Corporation is 450 employees strong, with approximately 600,000 square feet of manufacturing/warehousing space.
